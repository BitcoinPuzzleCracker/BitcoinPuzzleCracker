You must install the libraries required for the Python script. Run the command, and you’ll see which libraries you need. Install them one by one. After that, you can begin. Puzzle 35 and 71 of the Python script, you still need to change the path to your own folder’s path. Good luck!

This program is designed to crack Puzzle #71 by efficiently scanning and processing hexadecimal codes. Here's a clear explanation of how it works:

How the Program Works:
Scanning & Pool Collection

The program scans 8-digit hexadecimal codes (from a shared pool) and checks them against Puzzle 71, which consists of 18 hex characters.

The first 8 digits are taken from the pool (to avoid duplicate scans).

The remaining 10 digits are generated sequentially for exhaustive testing.

Avoiding Duplicates

Once a code is scanned, it is stored in the pool so that it is never scanned again, improving efficiency.

High-Speed Processing

Currently, this is the fastest known script for cracking Puzzle 71.

Users are encouraged to join forces to collectively solve the puzzle faster.

Testing & Verification

You can test the script on Puzzle #35 before applying it to Puzzle 71.

If a match is found, the program creates a found.txt file with the solution.

Future Development

A live website is in development to display real-time scanning progress.

The goal is to create a collaborative platform for puzzle-solving.
